## AI Chatbot

Pressing the star button opens up the AI chatbot, which is specialized in answering questions or executing actions around the site. However, you can still converse with the chatbot as normal.

## Entries

Every entry has a title, date, and a rating. To create or remove entries, you must ask the AI chatbot to do so. 

### Entering Entries

Click on an entry or ask the chatbot to open a specific entry. You will be taken inside the entry, where you can edit the actual journal entry, title, and rating. You can even ask the chatbot to rate the entry for you.

### Saving Entries

To reduce read & writes, either the "Save Text" button in the top left to save the information in an entry, or head back to the home page.  

## Analyze

The analysis page will summarize the entries of the past month, briefly highlighting what you have written about. There is also information regarding the average rating of the journals, and a chart that breaks down the day ratings.
